int, float - language datatypes
struct, class - user defined datatypes

struct - containes, access_specifiers - private and public, default access_specifiers is public
class - default access_specifiers is private
        setter and getter function - for private variables
        invariants/limit - conditions on the input variables

Encapsulation and Abstraction

Constructors and Default Constructors

Scope Resolution and Namespace
1. Namespace allow variables and functions to group it together
2. Scope Resolution allow us to identify the variables or method related object/Namespace

Intializer list --> directly assign the value to variable of class during creation
Mutators/Setter Function --> Copies the Value to the variable of class during creation. 
                             if an invariants are involved it better to use mutators/Setter functions

                             n fact, initialization lists ensure that member variables are initialized before the object is created. This is why class member variables can be declared const, but only if the member variable is initialized through an initialization list. Trying to initialize a const class member within the body of the constructor will not work.
